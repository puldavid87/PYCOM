## Theory:

### Functionality:

In this course, i2c communication is focused on sending messages between sensors and microcontrollers or between only microcontrollers.


### Libraries:
```
from machine import I2C
```
### Code Structures:
```
i2c = I2C(2) #
```
## Examples:
```
cx1.py -> Whitout library
cx2.py -> With librarby: lib folder
```
