# Simple Binary Classifier #

## Introduction ##
```
Machine learning algorithms can describe phenomena or human behavior through complex mathematical functions.
Therefore, they need high computational resources. However, tinyML is designed to run on small devices to improve 
the making decision process inside of it. Consequently, the classification algorithms learn from past experiences 
(training set) to assign new instances a pre-defined group (label).

## Step 1: Data acquisition ##

### System descryption: ###
The system proposed is to detect if the SCD30 (CO2, temperature, and humidity) sensor has been tampered with by people blowing on him. Therefore, the electronic system can detect two labels: adequate environmental data and tampered data. The code is developed in Python. 
## Step 2: Model construction ##
## Step 3: Export the inference ## 
## Step 4: Real tests ##
