# Simple Binary Classifier #

## Introduction ##
```
Machine learning algorithms can describe phenomena or human behavior through complex mathematical functions. Therefore, they need high computational resources. However, tinyML is designed to run on small devices to improve the making decision process inside of it. Consequently, the classification algorithms learn from past experiences (training set) to assign new instances a pre-defined group (label).
